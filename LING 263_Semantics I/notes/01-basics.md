# Semantics Basics

## The Origin of Meaning

* **Compositionality**
  * The theory of Compositionality states that the meaning of a sentence is determined by its parts.  
  * You can recursively descend a syntax tree to combine chunks of meaning into bigger chunks  
* **What is meaning?**  
  * Theory: understanding a declarative sentence is the ability to know if it’s true or false. (“meaning determines truth-conditions”)  
    * Formally: “show is white” is true iff snow is white

## Entailment and Implicatures

* **Entailment** is when sentence B is true if sentence A is true.  
  * Ex. “snow is white” ⇒ “something is white”  
  * Entailment is destroyed by negation; if sentence A is negated, the entailment is no longer valid  
  * The test for entailments is defeasibility. An entailment is not defeasible if negating sentence B after saying sentence A would be contradictory.  
    * Ex.  
      A: He speaks French, German, and Japanese.  
      B: He speaks more than one language.  
      **Defeasibility test**: “He speaks French, German, and Japanese. In fact, he only speaks one language.” (Nonsensical) → A entails B  
* **Presuppositions** are types of entailments, which the speaker and listener must share for the utterance to make sense.  
  * Ex. “They know my Uber was late” ⇒ “My Uber was late”  
    Ex. “The king of France is bald” ⇒ “There is a king of France”  
  * Presuppositions survive negation. Ex. “They don’t know my uber was late” ⇒ “My Uber was late”
