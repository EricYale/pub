# The Cooperative Principle

* The cooperative principle, devised by Grice, says that conversation partners try to be as helpful and clear as possible  
* Four maxims of the cooperative principle  
  * **Quantity**: give as much information as required, and no more  
  * **Quality**: be truthful and have evidence  
  * **Relation**: be relevant to the topic of conversation  
  * **Manner**: be clear, unambiguous, brief, and orderly
