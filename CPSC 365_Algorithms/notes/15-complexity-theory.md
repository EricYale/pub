# Complexity Theory

## Polynomial Time
- If an algorithm is efficient, you should be able to run it repeatedly.
- For a polynomial algorithm, if you run it a polynomial number of times, you get: $$n^c \times n^d = n^{c+d}$$ i.e. running a polynomial algorithm a polynomial number of times is still polynomial!
- Thus, we consider all polynomial-time algorithms to be efficient
- Computational problems are split into two categories:
    - Solvable in polynomial time
    - Problems not solvable in polynomial time
