# Runtime

## Runtime functions
- $O(n)$: an upper bound on a function
    - For example, the worst-case runtime of bubble sort satisfies $O(n^2)$, $O(n^3)$, _and_ $O(2^n)$
- $\Omega(n)$: a lower bound on a function
    - For example, the worst-case runtime of bubble sort satisfies $\Omega(1)$, $\Omega(n)$, _and_ $\Omega(n^2)$
- $\Theta(n)$: an upper _and_ lower bound on a function
    - For example, the worst-case runtime of bubble sort satisfies only $\Theta(n^2)$

_For sufficiently large n, and up to a constant factor_

## Worst-case, average-case, and best-case
- Worst-case: the maximum runtime of an algorithm
- Average-case: the average runtime of an algorithm
- Best-case: the minimum runtime of an algorithm
