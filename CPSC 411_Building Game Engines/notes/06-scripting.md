# Scripting

## Compiled Scripting
- Scripting can be implemented as Components that have overridden methods
- This way, the script and engine are written in the same language

## Interpreted Scripting
- Scripts (written in any language) are read by an interpreter by the game engine
- Access to game engine methods are done through a library made for the scripting language
