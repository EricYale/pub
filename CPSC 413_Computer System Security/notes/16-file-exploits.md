# File Exploits

## Local File Inclusion
- If a web server returns a local file, you can modify the path to access any file if the server isn't programmed correctly

```
https://example.com/?download=../../etc/passwd
```

- You can also upload malicious files to a website, hoping they will be executed
    - Example: GIFAR attack: make a file with a GIF header and a JAR footer, the server may open the gif and execute it as a JAR

## Insecure Direct Object References
- A service could use a parameter, like `?uid=`, to reference a file, e.g. a bank statement
- If the parameter isn't checked, you could change it to access other files

### Defenses
- Don't allow user to specify UID; instead, get the UID from the session token supplied with the request
- Use long random identifiers that will take way too long to guess
